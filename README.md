# minifilter-test-framework
This project aims at providing a framework using which unit test-cases can be built for file-system mini-filter drivers. The idea is to employ TDD (test-driven development) during the development of kernel mode drivers.

This entire framework has been written in C++ with additional dependency on boost libraries. I admit, boost library itself has not been used pretty heavily in the framework (I only make use of couple of features from boost) - as in I could have easily gone ahead with other alternatives but then that's way I've decided to go with. Feel free to fork the repo and customise it as you see fit.
